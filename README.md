# Backend-POC (Express.js + sequelize + AWS S3)

This is a backend proof of concept (POC) built with **Express.js**, **Sequelize**, **MySQL**, and **AWS S3** for file handling. The project is structured to support scalable development, clean API architecture, secure user authentication, role based authorization and file upload functionality.

- 🔐 JWT-based authentication
-     Role Based Authorization
- 📦 Sequelize ORM with MySQL
- ☁️ AWS S3 for secure file uploads
- ✅ ESLint + Husky for code quality
- 🚫 Soft delete functionality
- 🧠 Modular folder structure
-    Horizontal Scaled using token rotation and rate limitter

## About Project
- Uploading Images to S3
    A single image per user is stored. If a user uploads a new image, the old image is overwritten in the bucket (e.g. profile-1.jpg). Metadata in DB is updated accordingly.

- Linting & Husky
    ESLint v9 is configured with eslint.config.js. Husky runs lint checks before every commit
